@deftypefun {const gnutls_mac_algorithm_t *} {gnutls_mac_list} ( @var{void})

Get a list of hash algorithms for use as MACs.  Note that not
necessarily all MACs are supported in TLS cipher suites.  For
example, MD2 is not supported as a cipher suite, but is supported
for other purposes (e.g., X.509 signature verification or similar).

This function is not thread safe.

@strong{Returns:} Return a (0)-terminated list of @code{gnutls_mac_algorithm_t} 
integers indicating the available MACs.
