@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{cert}, gnutls_x509_dn_t * @var{dn})
@var{cert}: should contain a @code{gnutls_x509_crt_t}  structure

@var{dn}: output variable with pointer to uint8_t DN.

Return the Certificate's Subject DN as an uint8_t data type.  You
may use @code{gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava()}  to decode the DN. 

Note that  @code{dn} should be treated as constant. Because points 
into the  @code{cert} object, you may not deallocate  @code{cert} and continue to access  @code{dn} .

@strong{Returns:} Returns 0 on success, or an error code.
