@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_session_get_data} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, void * @var{session_data}, size_t * @var{session_data_size})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  structure.

@var{session_data}: is a pointer to space to hold the session.

@var{session_data_size}: is the session_data's size, or it will be set by the function.

Returns all session parameters, in order to support resuming.  The
client should call this, and keep the returned session, if he
wants to resume that current version later by calling
@code{gnutls_session_set_data()}  This function must be called after a
successful handshake.

Resuming sessions is really useful and speedups connections after
a successful one.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.
