@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava} (gnutls_x509_dn_t @var{dn}, int @var{irdn}, int @var{iava}, gnutls_x509_ava_st * @var{ava})
@var{dn}: input variable with uint8_t DN pointer

@var{irdn}: index of RDN

@var{iava}: index of AVA.

@var{ava}: Pointer to structure which will hold output information.

Get pointers to data within the DN.

Note that  @code{ava} will contain pointers into the  @code{dn} structure, so you
should not modify any data or deallocate it.  Note also that the DN
in turn points into the original certificate structure, and thus
you may not deallocate the certificate and continue to access  @code{dn} .

@strong{Returns:} Returns 0 on success, or an error code.
