@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_session_enable_compatibility_mode} (gnutls_session_t @var{session})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  structure.

This function can be used to disable certain (security) features in
TLS in order to maintain maximum compatibility with buggy
clients. It is equivalent to calling:
@code{gnutls_record_disable_padding()} 

Normally only servers that require maximum compatibility with
everything out there, need to call this function.
@end deftypefun
