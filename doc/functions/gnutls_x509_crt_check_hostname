@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{cert}, const char * @var{hostname})
@var{cert}: should contain an gnutls_x509_crt_t structure

@var{hostname}: A null terminated string that contains a DNS name

This function will check if the given certificate's subject matches
the given hostname.  This is a basic implementation of the matching
described in RFC2818 (HTTPS), which takes into account wildcards,
and the DNSName/IPAddress subject alternative name PKIX extension.

The comparison may have false-negatives as it is done byte by byte in 
non-ascii names.

Wildcards are only considered if the domain name consists of three
components or more, and the wildcard starts at the leftmost position.

@strong{Returns:} non-zero for a successful match, and zero on failure.
