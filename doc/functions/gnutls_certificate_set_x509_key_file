@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file} (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t @var{res}, const char * @var{certfile}, const char * @var{keyfile}, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t @var{type})
@var{res}: is a @code{gnutls_certificate_credentials_t}  structure.

@var{certfile}: is a file that containing the certificate list (path) for
the specified private key, in PKCS7 format, or a list of certificates

@var{keyfile}: is a file that contains the private key

@var{type}: is PEM or DER

This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure.  This function may be
called more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for
the server.  For clients that need to send more than its own end
entity certificate, e.g., also an intermediate CA cert, then the
 @code{certfile} must contain the ordered certificate chain.

This function can also accept PKCS @code{11}  URLs at  @code{keyfile} and  @code{certfile} . In that case it
will import the private key and certificate indicated by the URLs.

@strong{Returns:} @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) on success, or a negative error code.
