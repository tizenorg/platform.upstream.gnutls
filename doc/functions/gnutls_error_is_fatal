@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_error_is_fatal} (int @var{error})
@var{error}: is a GnuTLS error code, a negative error code

If a GnuTLS function returns a negative error code you may feed that
value to this function to see if the error condition is fatal. 
Note that you may also want to check the error code manually, since some
non-fatal errors to the protocol (such as a warning alert or
a rehandshake request) may be fatal for your program.

This function is only useful if you are dealing with errors from
the record layer or the handshake layer.

@strong{Returns:} 1 if the error code is fatal, for positive  @code{error} values,
0 is returned.  For unknown  @code{error} values, -1 is returned.
