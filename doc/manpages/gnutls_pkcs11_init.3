.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "int gnutls_pkcs11_init(unsigned int " flags ", const char * " deprecated_config_file ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.IP "const char * deprecated_config_file" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will initialize the PKCS 11 subsystem in gnutls. It will
read configuration files if \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO\fP is used or allow
you to independently load PKCS 11 modules using \fBgnutls_pkcs11_add_provider()\fP
if \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_MANUAL\fP is specified.

Normally you don't need to call this function since it is being called
by \fBgnutls_global_init()\fP using the \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO\fP. If other option
is required then it must be called before it.
