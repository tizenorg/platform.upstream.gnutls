.SH NAME
gnutls_ocsp_req_add_cert \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/ocsp.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_ocsp_req_add_cert(gnutls_ocsp_req_t " req ", gnutls_digest_algorithm_t " digest ", gnutls_x509_crt_t " issuer ", gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_ocsp_req_t req" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_ocsp_req_t\fP structure
.IP "gnutls_digest_algorithm_t digest" 12
hash algorithm, a \fBgnutls_digest_algorithm_t\fP value
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t issuer" 12
issuer of  \fIsubject\fP certificate
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
certificate to request status for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will add another request to the OCSP request for a
particular certificate.  The issuer name hash, issuer key hash, and
serial number fields is populated as follows.  The issuer name and
the serial number is taken from  \fIcert\fP .  The issuer key is taken
from  \fIissuer\fP .  The hashed values will be hashed using the  \fIdigest\fP algorithm, normally \fBGNUTLS_DIG_SHA1\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
